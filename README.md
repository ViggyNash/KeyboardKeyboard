# KeyboardKeyboard

Ever wanted to use a keyboard as a keyboard? Well now you can!
Ever wanted to play the keyboard with a keybard? You can do that too!

Now you can play your favorite code and code your favorite tunes!

Why would you want to? Who knows, but you can.

#todo:

- Making it work 100% instead of 90%.
- Adding it as a background process to all iLab machines at Rutgers
- Port to Windows
